I’m looking for the upsides to these panic-attack nights
where I’m staying in eating take-out food by TV light
I’m trying to play the b-side to this awkward life of mine
You could flip me over
I’d sing a few lines about how
I’m so used to shooting myself in the kneecaps
standing in the way of progress or letting down my friends

I’m nailing shards of hope together
to put something over my head
because you know here it’s always raining
and it happened again. It happened again
She said, “I let this slide when we were younger
You know you don’t have to write like this
The whole world’s full of losers
If you get a chance to win, take it”

I stood on the roof with Matt and Molly
Watched the gray slide off the city
because it’s finally spring
We rode our bikes over to 6th Street
to Washington Square Park
to see if the tides would turn for me

I’m nailing shards of hope together
to put something over my head
because you know here it’s always raining
and it happened again. It happened again
She said, “I let this slide when we were younger
You know you don’t have to write like this
The whole world’s full of losers
If you get a chance to win, take it”

I left a lot of blood in California
on our first trip out west
I was younger and restless back then
and I thought, if no one’s in my corner
since everyone left
I’d better make it worth it
