I'm not sad anymore, I'm just tired of this place.
The weight of the world be okay if it would pick a shoulder to lean on
So I could stand up straight.

I'm not sad anymore, I'm just tired of this place.
The homophobic bullshit that's somehow okay
Just because you didn't mean it that way.

I can't take anymore of all the scum in this place.
Shitty dudes with tribal tattoos all around,
Lining up cheap beer and roofies for a party at their place.
Trying to convince freshmen they're somebody
By spending all of their parents' money on kegstands
And Matt says I don't fit in.

All this mallrat goth shit is killing me.
Thought that would end with high school at least.
But there are still kids and Matt says
"College hit those dudes like a ton of bricks."

So they're calling it blasphemy,
A fucking catastrophe
For saying it's a stupid choice to make.
But this place just brings misery.
I hate what it does to me.
I fight, but I can't escape the way that I don't fit in with any of this.
And I don't think we're the same.

I'm fucking losing my head trying to understand this.
Kids outside with guitars hoping for someone to notice.
No one wants to hear your sappy bullshit.

All these fake-tan girls laughing at art school kids
Getting lots in return for being substance-less.
You're too caught in semantics to see it,
But you're no fucking different.

So they're calling it blasphemy,
A fucking catastrophe
For saying it's a stupid choice to make.
But this place just brings misery.
I hate what it does to me.
I fight, but I can't escape the way that I don't fit in with any of this.
And I don't think we're the same.

No.

I'm not sad anymore, I'm just waiting.
It's two more months 'til I'm done with this.
And I don't make sense to anyone but my best friends.
And I don't fit in anywhere but the back of the van.

They turned on the fountain today at Logan Circle,
I felt something in me change,
I was thinking about how we all feel,
But the world's not such a shitty place,
(The world's not such a shitty place)

We just can't blame the seasons,
The Blue Man Group won't cure depression,
I can see we brought it on ourselves with bad attitudes,
And you should come by at eleven,
You haven't seen the new apartment,
We'll laugh about the shit we got into in high school,
And I can't pretend,

I'm afraid that we're wasting away,
Because we're all sleeping in circles or talking shit in diners,
I've been better but I'm feeling okay,
I'm not even sad anymore,
I'm just so tired most nights,

And I've been drowning my sorrows in Lucky Charms and soy milk
These are the things that keep me sane,
Getting pretzels at midnight behind my house,
At the price you can't complain,

We set off fireworks, pissed off the whole neighbourhood,
They keep me up having sex anyway,
This stoop has been seen much worse,
We'll set off a few more,
Maybe I'll blow a piece of this city I hate,

I'm afraid that we're wasting away,
Because we're all sleeping in circles or talking shit in diners,
I've been better but I'm feeling okay,
I'm not even sad anymore,
I'm just so tired most nights,

They turned on the fountain today at Logan Circle,
They turned on the fountain today,
They turned on the fountain today at Logan Circle,
I felt something in me change,

I'm afraid that we're wasting away,
I'm afraid,
I'm afraid that we're wasting away,
Because we're all sleeping in circles or talking shit in diners,
I've been better but I'm feeling okay,
I'm not even sad anymore,
I'm just so tired most nights.

I woke up today and put all my shit in boxes,
It's 8am so I'm glad I wasn't out late,
I woke up today,
I guess it's good I hadn't finished unpacking all of this in the first place,

The suburbs have abandoned me,
I've had the same best friends since '93
I call he's not answering, No,
I can't get comfortable on my own street,
I'm not fond of South Philly,
Or how my neighbours love ICP,
I guess it's better than Bancroft Street,
At least the fridge here works and the walls don't leak,
At least I'm starting to see what's left for me
I'm starting to,

We moved on again,
So I packed all my shit and left home,
It's all right to think I still belong to something I don't,
'Casue I can see why you'd think so,

Nothing made me feel further away,
Than "Left and Leaving" through a blown car stereo,
Nothing made me feel closer to home,
Than "Ready to Die" through my headphones,

So, we reached the coast,
Where do we sleep tonight?
Damned if I know,
We'll try to stay at the airport,
"You can't send us home man, We've got no place to go",

We moved on again,
So I packed all my shit and left home,
It's all right to think I still belong to something I don't,
'Cause I can see why you'd think so,
'Cause I can see why you'd think so,

Don't say it's up to me
Don't say it's up to me
Don't say it's up to me
Don't say it's up to me

The creeks in the floorboards are calling out to me,
I'm laying here again,
with my head on my backpack,
Wrapped in my hoodie,
This is how it is when,

Don't say it's up to me,
Don't Say,

We moved on again,
So I packed all my shit and left home,
It's all right to think I still belong to something I don't,
'Cause I can see why you'd think so,

We moved on again,
So I packed all my shit and left home,
It's all right to think I still belong to something I don't,
'Cause I can see why you'd think so,

I stacked "Lonelier than God" next to "You Get So Alone Sometimes",
I know how this must look from the outside,
It took almost thirteen months for me to be where I feel fine,
I'm not as sad as I let myself believe sometimes.

Rest stop in Tennessee
I found where the ignorant fucks of the world meet
For donuts and coffee
Spewing rhetoric I thought was reserved for
Westboro Baptist and lunatics like that
So you can hide behind the bible
We still know you're fucked
Inbreeding can claim this one
So chalk it up
These small town minds stay small
The world evolved so stay in your shithole
We're moving on
Someone should burn this place to the ground
I'll see you motherfuckers in hell

Two miles from the hotel, eight hundred from home
We're forced to call on all we know
But all we know's a joke
The van just started shaking, coughing out black smoke
We're pulling off in a parking lot cause this might just explode
Cause it's New Year's Eve and four degrees
We're stranded, hopeless
I just want some sleep
Drew's too busy sexting with some girl he met last show
Tripping balls from the soft effects of a Nyquil overdose
Nobody's been asking how we're gonna get home
Cause we all know
We'll deal with it tomorrow
Yeah, we know

It's gonna be our year, boys
I'd speak up
But I'm waiting for the irony to fall asleep without me
And we'll wait and see
With some luck and patching up
I think I'll be home this week

We'll deal with it our own way
And we'll stay, and we'll wait,
And we'll wake in this awkward mess we made
A landscape forged from pizza crust
And what's left of a case
We'll make friends in every state
Like the cops in the parking lot
Or staff of Steak'N'Shake

It's gonna be our year, boys
I'd speak up
But I'm waiting for the irony to fall asleep without me
And we'll wait and see
With some luck and patching up
I think I'll be home this week

But I'm too tired to speak
I'll say, "Hey man, I'll see you in Cleveland"

Someone go tell the universe we're not concerned
We know that it's out to get us
But we'll never learn
So if you're thinking you just got the best of me
Man, we don't go down that easy

It's gonna be our year, boys
I'd speak up
But I'm waiting for the irony to fall asleep without me
And we'll wait and see
With some luck and patching up
I think I'll be home this week

It's goddamn freezing in this city
There's no heat in my room
It's like it never stops raining
And I'm soaked through
My life's become this tightrope act
One wrong step, I'm off the edge
So now I'm scared to death of an ear infection
It's like I'm chasing ambulances
Trying to pull out something from the wreckage
Nothing ever goes the way we fucking planned it

Cause most days are bad days
We can't wait for someone to pull me off of the concrete
We stopped standing proud a year ago now
What you see is just a shell of who I used to be
I can't believe I got this weak

I'm stuck here wide awake
In the wake of bad news
We know now what's at stake
And I'm scared too
You know that I can't take naps
Cause they end in panic attacks
I can't play video games
Cause I always end up depressed
I can't be left alone now for even a second
I'm a burden but at least I know it

Most days are bad days
We can't wait for someone to pull me off of the concrete
We stopped standing proud a year ago now
What you see is just a shell of who I used to be
I can't believe I got this weak

And I don't think I love anything
The way that some people love Morrissey
It's just that nothing speaks to me that way
And I, I can tell you that the world looks bleak
From where I'm sitting at the bottom of the city
But no matter where you sit
The skyline looks the same

And I don't think I love anything like
Most days are bad days, we can't just wait

So you found me on the floor,
I'm split open at the seams,
The lights of Birmingham are wet
and blur in front of me,
Today we woke up at 1,
but it gets dark here at 3,
It's getting hard to believe in anything,

Today I called up my dad,
Said "I'm off balance and weak",
I'm feeling homesick for things I know don't think of me,
He said "It's gonna get lighter, son, just wait there and see",
It's getting hard to believe,

Last night in Leeds,
Ad and I found ourselves wandering the city,
looking for pizza,
All we found was complacency and somewhere to sleep,

I'm still waiting for the map to say home's a week away,

The boys are drowning in Strongbow,
I'm amazed they can breathe,
Weeble's just got caught stealing a Christmas tree,
We drove all the way to Glasgow just watch our defeat,
The venue flooded,
Guess the band last night was too heavy,

Last night in Leeds,
Joe was talking to some bar maid,
Trying to get lucky,
I think it almost worked until he ran into Bobby,
That kid pulled the cock-block of the century,

I'm still waiting for the map to say home's a week away,
Unless Grey Britain comes to me and says,
"It's not so bad if you don't look at it that way"

Last night in Leeds,
The world collapsed all around me,
Along with a shelf in the basement of Liv's house,
By two or three, I thought we'd lost Josh and Mikey,
They were skyhooking cans they hadn't emptied out,

Last night in Leeds,
I know we woke the neighbours,
But I don't think anybody slept that night,
Last night in Leeds,
things got a bit lighter,
I Guess my dad was Right,

I'm still waiting for the map to say home's a week away,
Unless Grey Britain comes to me and says,
"It's not so bad if you don't look at it that way"

I hate your bad tattoos and your second-hand stories;
those anecdotes that grew old last month. 
I hate the way you move when you’re drunk and try dancing. 
It’s not sexy. 
It’s just keeping us up and I’m just not fond of anyone, 
but that’s got everything to do with us. 

I hate the way I get when I can’t handle bad news. 
It feels like I’ve been an asshole for months.
All I’ve got left are these handfuls of fuck you and man, 
that’s never enough. 

I guess I’m just down. 
I guess I’ll be honest. 
I could use you around. 
I can’t stand the dork that you’re hanging with now. 
I guess I’ll be honest. 
I could use you around. 

I hate the way that you can’t keep your hair straight. 
I hate the way that you’re leaning on me. 
I hate the way that you point out when girls are staring 
because you know that I won’t do a thing. 

I hate the context clues you leave out of your writing 
because I can’t find myself here at all. 
You know that I hate when you call me wasted. 
I expect it whenever you call. 

I guess I’m just down. 
I guess I’ll be honest. 
I could use you around. 
I can’t stand the dork that you’re hanging with now. 
I guess I’ll be honest. 
I could use you around. 
I could use you around. 
I could use you around now.

My friends all say he’s just a b-rate version of me; 
he’s stuck on video games and weed. 
They’re just trying to help me get to sleep. 

My friends all say you’re sitting way too close to me, 
that I should just get up and leave. 
It’s like I’m weighed down to the seat. 

My friends all say he’s just the broke-dick version of me. 
They’re just trying to help me get some sleep. 
I know he’s what you need.

I guess I’m just down. 
I guess I’ll be honest. 
I could use you around. 
I can’t stand the dork that you’re hanging with now. 
I guess I’ll be honest. 
I could use you around.

In case you were wondering
I can't get comfortable in my own skin
But it was bound to happen

In case you were wondering
I'm twenty three and avoiding the bar scene
Lycra pants, and designer jeans
In case you were wondering
I'm staying in
I won't smell like cheap perfume or cigarettes tonight

And every word that I said got drowned out
By a dance remix of a pop song I don't care about
In case you forgot how bad I've been down
Just ask around 'cause you know this town loves to run its mouth

Say, say you'll stay in with me today
Say, say you'll stay.
'Cause you won't find me on the north Jersey club scene
With the Girls Gone Wild B-team
I don't need to pump my fist to look sweet

In case you were wondering
I promised myself that I would try to be more social at parties
Can someone tell these kids liking the rain no longer counts as an idiosyncrasy
In fact, I think that Rupert Holmes wrote a song about it in the '70s
And consequently, he also saved the Pina Colada industry

Say, say you'll stay in with me today
Say, say you'll stay
'Cause you won't find me on the north Jersey club scene
With the Girls Gone Wild B-team
I don't need to pump my fist to look sweet

Say, say, say, say you'll stay
Say, say, say, say you'll stay

I can't believe I ended up here again
watching this terrible band play songs I hate in the basement
I can't believe that I got stuck here again
while the kid with the dreads tells me he's smarter on acid
I can't believe that I'm not running away so just say

Say, say, say, say you'll stay
Say, say you'll stay in with me today
Say, say you'll stay
'Cause you won't find me on the north Jersey club scene
With the Girls Gone Wild B-team
I don't need to pump my fist to look sweet

Say, say, say, say you'll stay
