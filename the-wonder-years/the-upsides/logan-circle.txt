They turned on the fountain today at Logan Circle,
I felt something in me change,
I was thinking about how we all feel,
But the world's not such a shitty place,
(The world's not such a shitty place)

We just can't blame the seasons,
The Blue Man Group won't cure depression,
I can see we brought it on ourselves with bad attitudes,
And you should come by at eleven,
You haven't seen the new apartment,
We'll laugh about the shit we got into in high school,
And I can't pretend,

I'm afraid that we're wasting away,
Because we're all sleeping in circles or talking shit in diners,
I've been better but I'm feeling okay,
I'm not even sad anymore,
I'm just so tired most nights,

And I've been drowning my sorrows in Lucky Charms and soy milk
These are the things that keep me sane,
Getting pretzels at midnight behind my house,
At the price you can't complain,

We set off fireworks, pissed off the whole neighbourhood,
They keep me up having sex anyway,
This stoop has been seen much worse,
We'll set off a few more,
Maybe I'll blow a piece of this city I hate,

I'm afraid that we're wasting away,
Because we're all sleeping in circles or talking shit in diners,
I've been better but I'm feeling okay,
I'm not even sad anymore,
I'm just so tired most nights,

They turned on the fountain today at Logan Circle,
They turned on the fountain today,
They turned on the fountain today at Logan Circle,
I felt something in me change,

I'm afraid that we're wasting away,
I'm afraid,
I'm afraid that we're wasting away,
Because we're all sleeping in circles or talking shit in diners,
I've been better but I'm feeling okay,
I'm not even sad anymore,
I'm just so tired most nights.
