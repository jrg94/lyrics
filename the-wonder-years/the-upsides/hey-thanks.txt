Hey thanks for everything
For putting up with me when I get cranky
I know I'm such a pain
And yeah thanks for losing everything with me
The night we went to Atlantic City
Of course it had to rain

And you think that I'm angry
But I think that you're sad
We know it's not so bad
Here living the life we have

So hey thanks for not hating me
When I wake you up at eight in the morning
Because I lost the keys
And yeah thanks for staying in with me
I know you'd probably rather be out drinking
Than in with the TV

And you think that I'm angry
But I think that you're sad
We know it's not so bad
Here living the life we have
So hey thanks

I'm not sad anymore
And you think that I'm angry
But I think that you're sad
We know it's not so bad
Here living the life we have
So hey thanks
