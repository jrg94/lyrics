I woke up today and put all my shit in boxes,
It's 8am so I'm glad I wasn't out late,
I woke up today,
I guess it's good I hadn't finished unpacking all of this in the first place,

The suburbs have abandoned me,
I've had the same best friends since '93
I call he's not answering, No,
I can't get comfortable on my own street,
I'm not fond of South Philly,
Or how my neighbours love ICP,
I guess it's better than Bancroft Street,
At least the fridge here works and the walls don't leak,
At least I'm starting to see what's left for me
I'm starting to,

We moved on again,
So I packed all my shit and left home,
It's all right to think I still belong to something I don't,
'Casue I can see why you'd think so,

Nothing made me feel further away,
Than "Left and Leaving" through a blown car stereo,
Nothing made me feel closer to home,
Than "Ready to Die" through my headphones,

So, we reached the coast,
Where do we sleep tonight?
Damned if I know,
We'll try to stay at the airport,
"You can't send us home man, We've got no place to go",

We moved on again,
So I packed all my shit and left home,
It's all right to think I still belong to something I don't,
'Cause I can see why you'd think so,
'Cause I can see why you'd think so,

Don't say it's up to me
Don't say it's up to me
Don't say it's up to me
Don't say it's up to me

The creeks in the floorboards are calling out to me,
I'm laying here again,
with my head on my backpack,
Wrapped in my hoodie,
This is how it is when,

Don't say it's up to me,
Don't Say,

We moved on again,
So I packed all my shit and left home,
It's all right to think I still belong to something I don't,
'Cause I can see why you'd think so,

We moved on again,
So I packed all my shit and left home,
It's all right to think I still belong to something I don't,
'Cause I can see why you'd think so,

I stacked "Lonelier than God" next to "You Get So Alone Sometimes",
I know how this must look from the outside,
It took almost thirteen months for me to be where I feel fine,
I'm not as sad as I let myself believe sometimes.
