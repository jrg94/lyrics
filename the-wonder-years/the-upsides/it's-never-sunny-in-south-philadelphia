It's goddamn freezing in this city
There's no heat in my room
It's like it never stops raining
And I'm soaked through
My life's become this tightrope act
One wrong step, I'm off the edge
So now I'm scared to death of an ear infection
It's like I'm chasing ambulances
Trying to pull out something from the wreckage
Nothing ever goes the way we fucking planned it

Cause most days are bad days
We can't wait for someone to pull me off of the concrete
We stopped standing proud a year ago now
What you see is just a shell of who I used to be
I can't believe I got this weak

I'm stuck here wide awake
In the wake of bad news
We know now what's at stake
And I'm scared too
You know that I can't take naps
Cause they end in panic attacks
I can't play video games
Cause I always end up depressed
I can't be left alone now for even a second
I'm a burden but at least I know it

Most days are bad days
We can't wait for someone to pull me off of the concrete
We stopped standing proud a year ago now
What you see is just a shell of who I used to be
I can't believe I got this weak

And I don't think I love anything
The way that some people love Morrissey
It's just that nothing speaks to me that way
And I, I can tell you that the world looks bleak
From where I'm sitting at the bottom of the city
But no matter where you sit
The skyline looks the same

And I don't think I love anything like
Most days are bad days, we can't just wait
