So you found me on the floor,
I'm split open at the seams,
The lights of Birmingham are wet
and blur in front of me,
Today we woke up at 1,
but it gets dark here at 3,
It's getting hard to believe in anything,

Today I called up my dad,
Said "I'm off balance and weak",
I'm feeling homesick for things I know don't think of me,
He said "It's gonna get lighter, son, just wait there and see",
It's getting hard to believe,

Last night in Leeds,
Ad and I found ourselves wandering the city,
looking for pizza,
All we found was complacency and somewhere to sleep,

I'm still waiting for the map to say home's a week away,

The boys are drowning in Strongbow,
I'm amazed they can breathe,
Weeble's just got caught stealing a Christmas tree,
We drove all the way to Glasgow just watch our defeat,
The venue flooded,
Guess the band last night was too heavy,

Last night in Leeds,
Joe was talking to some bar maid,
Trying to get lucky,
I think it almost worked until he ran into Bobby,
That kid pulled the cock-block of the century,

I'm still waiting for the map to say home's a week away,
Unless Grey Britain comes to me and says,
"It's not so bad if you don't look at it that way"

Last night in Leeds,
The world collapsed all around me,
Along with a shelf in the basement of Liv's house,
By two or three, I thought we'd lost Josh and Mikey,
They were skyhooking cans they hadn't emptied out,

Last night in Leeds,
I know we woke the neighbours,
But I don't think anybody slept that night,
Last night in Leeds,
things got a bit lighter,
I Guess my dad was Right,

I'm still waiting for the map to say home's a week away,
Unless Grey Britain comes to me and says,
"It's not so bad if you don't look at it that way"
