In case you were wondering
I can't get comfortable in my own skin
But it was bound to happen

In case you were wondering
I'm twenty three and avoiding the bar scene
Lycra pants, and designer jeans
In case you were wondering
I'm staying in
I won't smell like cheap perfume or cigarettes tonight

And every word that I said got drowned out
By a dance remix of a pop song I don't care about
In case you forgot how bad I've been down
Just ask around 'cause you know this town loves to run its mouth

Say, say you'll stay in with me today
Say, say you'll stay.
'Cause you won't find me on the north Jersey club scene
With the Girls Gone Wild B-team
I don't need to pump my fist to look sweet

In case you were wondering
I promised myself that I would try to be more social at parties
Can someone tell these kids liking the rain no longer counts as an idiosyncrasy
In fact, I think that Rupert Holmes wrote a song about it in the '70s
And consequently, he also saved the Pina Colada industry

Say, say you'll stay in with me today
Say, say you'll stay
'Cause you won't find me on the north Jersey club scene
With the Girls Gone Wild B-team
I don't need to pump my fist to look sweet

Say, say, say, say you'll stay
Say, say, say, say you'll stay

I can't believe I ended up here again
watching this terrible band play songs I hate in the basement
I can't believe that I got stuck here again
while the kid with the dreads tells me he's smarter on acid
I can't believe that I'm not running away so just say

Say, say, say, say you'll stay
Say, say you'll stay in with me today
Say, say you'll stay
'Cause you won't find me on the north Jersey club scene
With the Girls Gone Wild B-team
I don't need to pump my fist to look sweet

Say, say, say, say you'll stay
