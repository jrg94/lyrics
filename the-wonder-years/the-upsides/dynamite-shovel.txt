Rest stop in Tennessee
I found where the ignorant fucks of the world meet
For donuts and coffee
Spewing rhetoric I thought was reserved for
Westboro Baptist and lunatics like that
So you can hide behind the bible
We still know you're fucked
Inbreeding can claim this one
So chalk it up
These small town minds stay small
The world evolved so stay in your shithole
We're moving on
Someone should burn this place to the ground
I'll see you motherfuckers in hell
